To solve this problem, we can use the concept of dynamic programming. We will create a 2D boolean array, dp, where dp[i][j] will be true if the substring from index i to j is a palindrome.

1. Initialize dp[i][i] as true for all i, since single characters are palindromes.
2. Initialize maxLen = 1 and start = 0, which will keep track of the longest palindrome found so far.
3. Iterate over the string from length 2 to n:
   a. For each length, iterate over the string from index 0 to n - length:
      - Set end = start + length - 1.
      - If the characters at start and end are equal and dp[start+1][end-1] is true (i.e., the substring between start and end is a palindrome), then set dp[start][end] as true.
      - If dp[start][end] is true and length is greater than maxLen, update maxLen and start.
4. Print the substring of the input string from start to start + maxLen - 1.

Here is the C++ code that implements the above algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

string longestPalindrome(string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    vector<vector<bool>> dp(n, vector<bool>(n, false));

    // Single characters are palindromes
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i][i] = true;
    }

    int maxLen = 1, start = 0;

    // Check for palindromes of length 2 or more
    for (int length = 2; length <= n; length++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n - length + 1; i++) {
            int end = i + length - 1;

            if (s[i] == s[end]) {
                // If inner substring is palindrome, then current substring is also palindrome
                if (length == 2 || dp[i + 1][end - 1]) {
                    dp[i][end] = true;

                    if (length > maxLen) {
                        maxLen = length;
                        start = i;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return s.substr(start, maxLen);
}

int main() {
    string s;
    cin >> s;

    cout << longestPalindrome(s) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This code has a time complexity of O(n^2) and space complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string.
