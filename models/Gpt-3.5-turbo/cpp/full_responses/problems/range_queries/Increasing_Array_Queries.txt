To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a technique called prefix sums.

First, we need to preprocess the array to calculate the prefix sums. Let's create an array `prefix` of size n+1, where `prefix[i]` will store the sum of the first i elements of the input array.

Next, for each query, we can calculate the minimum number of operations required to make the subarray increasing by comparing the value at position a with the sum of the previous elements in the subarray (i.e., `prefix[a-1]`). If the value at position a is smaller than the prefix sum, we need to add the difference between them to make it increasing. Otherwise, no operations are required.

Here is the C++ code that implements this approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;

    vector<int> arr(n + 1);
    vector<long long> prefix(n + 1);

    // Read the input array
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        cin >> arr[i];
    }

    // Calculate the prefix sums
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + arr[i];
    }

    // Process the queries
    while (q--) {
        int a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;

        // Calculate the minimum number of operations
        int operations = arr[a] - prefix[a - 1];

        // Print the result
        cout << operations << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The overall time complexity of this solution is O(n + q), which is efficient enough to handle the given constraints.
