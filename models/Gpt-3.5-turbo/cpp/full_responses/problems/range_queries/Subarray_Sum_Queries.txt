To solve this problem optimally, we can make use of the Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum efficiently.

First, we initialize two variables `curr_sum` and `max_sum` to 0. These variables will keep track of the current sum of the subarray and the maximum sum found so far.

For each update, we update the value at the given position in the array. Then, we iterate through the array from left to right and update `curr_sum` as follows:
- If `curr_sum` is positive, we add the current element to it.
- If `curr_sum` is negative or zero, we start a new subarray with the current element.

After updating `curr_sum`, we update `max_sum` if `curr_sum` is greater than `max_sum`.

Finally, we print `max_sum` after each update.

Here is the C++ implementation of the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    vector<int> arr(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> arr[i];
    }

    int curr_sum = 0, max_sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        curr_sum += arr[i];
        max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum);
        curr_sum = max(curr_sum, 0);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int k, x;
        cin >> k >> x;
        k--;

        curr_sum += x - arr[k];
        max_sum = max(max_sum, curr_sum);
        arr[k] = x;

        cout << max_sum << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where n is the size of the array and m is the number of updates. This is because we need to iterate through the array once to calculate the initial maximum subarray sum, and then iterate through the updates. Both iterations have a linear time complexity.
