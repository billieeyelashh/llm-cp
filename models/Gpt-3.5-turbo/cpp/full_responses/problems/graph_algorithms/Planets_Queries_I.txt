To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a technique called "cycle detection". We observe that for each planet, following the teleporters will eventually lead to a cycle. Once we reach a planet that we have already visited, we know that the cycle has started.

To implement this, we can use an array `visited` of size `n` to keep track of whether we have visited a planet or not. Initially, we set all elements of `visited` to false.

For each query, we start at the given planet `x` and follow the teleporters `k` times. While following the teleporters, we mark each planet as visited in the `visited` array.

If we encounter a planet that is already visited, we know that we have entered a cycle. To find the planet we will reach after `k` teleportations, we need to determine the length of the cycle and calculate the remaining number of teleportations after the cycle is completed. We can do this by keeping track of the number of teleportations (`teleport_count`) and the current planet (`current_planet`) while following the teleporters.

Once we detect a cycle, we calculate the length of the cycle by subtracting the current teleportation count (`teleport_count`) from the teleportation count when we first visited the current planet (`visited[current_planet]`). We then calculate the remaining teleportations by subtracting the current teleportation count from the given `k`.

Finally, we can determine the planet we will reach after `k` teleportations by starting at the initial planet `x` and following the teleporters for the remaining teleportations.

Here is the final solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;

    vector<int> destinations(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        cin >> destinations[i];
    }

    vector<bool> visited(n + 1, false);
    for (int i = 0; i < q; ++i) {
        int x, k;
        cin >> x >> k;

        int current_planet = x;
        int teleport_count = 0;
        while (!visited[current_planet]) {
            visited[current_planet] = true;
            current_planet = destinations[current_planet];
            ++teleport_count;
        }

        int cycle_length = teleport_count - visited[current_planet];
        int remaining_teleports = k % cycle_length;

        current_planet = x;
        for (int j = 0; j < remaining_teleports; ++j) {
            current_planet = destinations[current_planet];
        }

        cout << current_planet << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(q), where q is the number of queries.
