To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking algorithm. We will start at the given starting position and try to visit all the squares on the chessboard.

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Global variables to represent the chessboard and the current knight position
vector<vector<int>> board(8, vector<int>(8, 0));
int dx[] = {2, 2, -2, -2, 1, 1, -1, -1};
int dy[] = {1, -1, 1, -1, 2, -2, 2, -2};

// Function to check if a move is valid
bool isValidMove(int x, int y) {
    return (x >= 0 && x < 8 && y >= 0 && y < 8 && board[x][y] == 0);
}

// Recursive function to find the knight's tour
bool findKnightTour(int x, int y, int count) {
    // Mark the current square as visited
    board[x][y] = count;

    // Base case: if all squares are visited, return true
    if (count == 64) {
        return true;
    }

    // Try all possible moves from the current position
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        int nextX = x + dx[i];
        int nextY = y + dy[i];

        // Check if the next move is valid
        if (isValidMove(nextX, nextY)) {
            // Recursive call to explore the next move
            if (findKnightTour(nextX, nextY, count + 1)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }

    // If no valid move is found, backtrack and reset the current square
    board[x][y] = 0;
    return false;
}

int main() {
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;

    // Start the knight's tour from the given position
    findKnightTour(x - 1, y - 1, 1);

    // Print the knight's tour
    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
            cout << board[i][j] << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code uses a backtracking algorithm to find a valid sequence of moves for the knight to visit all squares on the chessboard. It starts at the given starting position and explores all possible moves from the current position.

The `isValidMove` function checks if a move is valid by ensuring that the next position is within the bounds of the chessboard and has not been visited before.

The `findKnightTour` function is the recursive function that performs the backtracking. It marks the current square as visited and tries all possible moves from the current position. If a valid move is found, it recursively explores the next move. If all squares are visited, it returns true to indicate a valid knight's tour has been found. Otherwise, it backtracks and resets the current square before trying the next move.

In the `main` function, we read the starting position from the input and call the `findKnightTour` function to find the knight's tour. Finally, we print the chessboard to show the sequence of moves made by the knight.
