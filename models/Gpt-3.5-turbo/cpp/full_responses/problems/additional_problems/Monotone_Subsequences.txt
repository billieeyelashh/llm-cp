To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. For each test case, if $k$ is equal to $n$, it is impossible to have a permutation with exactly $k$ elements in the longest monotone subsequence. In this case, we print "IMPOSSIBLE" and move to the next test case.

2. Otherwise, we can construct a valid permutation by starting with the numbers from $k$ to $1$, in decreasing order. Then, we append the remaining numbers from $k+1$ to $n$ in increasing order.

Here is the C++ code that implements this approach:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void solve(int n, int k) {
    if (k == n) {
        cout << "IMPOSSIBLE\n";
        return;
    }

    vector<int> permutation;
    for (int i = k; i >= 1; i--) {
        permutation.push_back(i);
    }

    for (int i = k + 1; i <= n; i++) {
        permutation.push_back(i);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << permutation[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;

    while (t--) {
        int n, k;
        cin >> n >> k;
        solve(n, k);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code reads the number of test cases $t$ from the input, and for each test case, it reads the values of $n$ and $k$. The `solve` function is then called to find and print the valid permutation.

The time complexity of this solution is $O(n)$ for each test case, where $n$ is the size of the permutation.
