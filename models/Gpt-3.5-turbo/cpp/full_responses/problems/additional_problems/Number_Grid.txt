To solve this problem optimally, we can observe the pattern in the grid.

We can see that the value in square $(y,x)$ is equal to the maximum of $y$ and $x$. In other words, the value at square $(y,x)$ is the larger of the two coordinates.

Therefore, our final solution in C++ would be:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int y, x;
    cin >> y >> x;

    int result = max(y, x);
    cout << result << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
