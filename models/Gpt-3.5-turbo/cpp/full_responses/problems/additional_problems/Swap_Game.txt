To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the minimum number of moves required.

First, we need to represent the state of the grid. We can use a 2D array to store the numbers, where the indices (i, j) represent the row and column of the grid, respectively.

Next, we can define a struct called "State" to represent a state of the grid. The struct will have two members: the grid itself and an integer representing the number of moves taken to reach that state.

Now, let's outline the steps of the BFS algorithm:

1. Initialize a queue and a set to store visited states.
2. Create an initial state by reading the input grid and setting the number of moves to 0.
3. Enqueue the initial state into the queue.
4. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue a state from the front of the queue.
   b. Check if the grid is in the desired state (1 2 3, 4 5 6, 7 8 9). If it is, return the number of moves taken to reach that state.
   c. Generate all possible next states by swapping adjacent numbers in the grid.
   d. For each next state, check if it has been visited before. If not, enqueue it into the queue and mark it as visited.
5. If the queue becomes empty and no desired state is found, return -1 (indicating that it is impossible to reach the desired state).

Here is the final C++ solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
#include <set>
using namespace std;

struct State {
    int grid[3][3];
    int moves;
};

int main() {
    int grid[3][3];

    // Read the input grid
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
            cin >> grid[i][j];
        }
    }

    // Define the desired grid
    int desiredGrid[3][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};

    // Initialize the queue and visited set
    queue<State> q;
    set<State> visited;

    // Create the initial state
    State initialState;
    memcpy(initialState.grid, grid, sizeof(grid)); // Copy the grid
    initialState.moves = 0;

    // Enqueue the initial state
    q.push(initialState);
    visited.insert(initialState);

    // Perform BFS
    while (!q.empty()) {
        State currState = q.front();
        q.pop();

        // Check if the grid is in the desired state
        if (memcmp(currState.grid, desiredGrid, sizeof(desiredGrid)) == 0) {
            cout << currState.moves << endl;
            return 0;
        }

        // Generate all possible next states
        int dx[4] = {0, 0, 1, -1};
        int dy[4] = {1, -1, 0, 0};

        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
                    int ni = i + dx[k];
                    int nj = j + dy[k];

                    if (ni >= 0 && ni < 3 && nj >= 0 && nj < 3) {
                        State nextState = currState;
                        swap(nextState.grid[i][j], nextState.grid[ni][nj]);
                        nextState.moves++;

                        // Check if the next state has been visited before
                        if (visited.find(nextState) == visited.end()) {
                            q.push(nextState);
                            visited.insert(nextState);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // If no desired state is found
    cout << -1 << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The solution uses a BFS algorithm to find the minimum number of moves required to reach the desired state. It uses a queue to store the states to be explored and a set to keep track of visited states. The algorithm terminates when the desired state is reached or when there are no more states to explore.
