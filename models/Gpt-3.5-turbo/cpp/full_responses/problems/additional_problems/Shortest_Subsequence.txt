To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. 

First, we need to define what it means for a DNA sequence to be a subsequence of another sequence. A DNA sequence is a subsequence of another sequence if it can be obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from the original sequence without changing the order of the remaining characters.

Now, let's proceed with the solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    string dna_sequence;
    cin >> dna_sequence;

    string shortest_sequence;
    for (char c : dna_sequence) {
        if (c == 'A') {
            shortest_sequence += "T";
        } else if (c == 'T') {
            shortest_sequence += "A";
        } else if (c == 'C') {
            shortest_sequence += "G";
        } else if (c == 'G') {
            shortest_sequence += "C";
        }
    }

    cout << shortest_sequence << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we iterate over each character in the given DNA sequence. For each character, we append its complement to the `shortest_sequence` string. The complement of 'A' is 'T', the complement of 'T' is 'A', the complement of 'C' is 'G', and the complement of 'G' is 'C'.

Finally, we print the `shortest_sequence` which is guaranteed to not be a subsequence of the original sequence.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the DNA sequence.
