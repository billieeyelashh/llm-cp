To solve this problem, we can observe that for a grid to be filled with L-trominos, the number of cells in the grid must be divisible by 3.

Algorithm:
1. Read the number of test cases, t.
2. For each test case, do the following steps:
   a. Read the dimensions of the grid, n and m.
   b. If n * m is not divisible by 3, print NO and continue to the next test case.
   c. Create a 2D array of characters with dimensions n x m.
   d. Fill the grid with 'A' in the first row and 'B' in the first column.
   e. Iterate over the remaining cells of the grid using nested loops:
      - If the cell is in an even row and an odd column, assign the character at the cell as the character one column to the left.
      - If the cell is in an odd row and an even column, assign the character at the cell as the character one row above.
      - Otherwise, assign the character at the cell as the character one cell to the top-left.
   f. Print YES.
   g. Print the contents of the grid.

Here is the C++ code implementing the above algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

bool solveGrid(int n, int m) {
    if (n * m % 3 != 0) {
        return false;
    }

    vector<vector<char>> grid(n, vector<char>(m));

    // Fill the first row with 'A'
    for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
        grid[0][j] = 'A';
    }

    // Fill the first column with 'B'
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        grid[i][0] = 'B';
    }

    // Fill the remaining cells
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0 && j % 2 == 1) {
                grid[i][j] = grid[i][j - 1];
            } else if (i % 2 == 1 && j % 2 == 0) {
                grid[i][j] = grid[i - 1][j];
            } else {
                grid[i][j] = grid[i - 1][j - 1];
            }
        }
    }

    return true;
}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;

    while (t--) {
        int n, m;
        cin >> n >> m;

        if (solveGrid(n, m)) {
            cout << "YES" << endl;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                    cout << grid[i][j];
                }
                cout << endl;
            }
        } else {
            cout << "NO" << endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid. It then calls the `solveGrid` function to check if a solution exists and prints the result accordingly. If a solution is found, it prints the contents of the grid.
