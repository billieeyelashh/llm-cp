To solve this problem, we can use the concept of connected components in a graph. We need to find all the cities that are not connected to each other and add flights between them.

First, we will create an adjacency list to represent the flights between cities. Then, we will perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from each city to find all the reachable cities. If a city is not reachable from any other city, it means it is not connected to the rest of the cities.

To implement this solution in C++, we can use the following code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> adj;
vector<bool> visited;

void dfs(int u) {
    visited[u] = true;
    for (int v : adj[u]) {
        if (!visited[v]) {
            dfs(v);
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;

    adj.resize(n + 1);
    visited.resize(n + 1, false);

    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        int a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;
        adj[a].push_back(b);
    }

    vector<int> disconnected_cities;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            disconnected_cities.push_back(i);
            dfs(i);
        }
    }

    int k = disconnected_cities.size();
    cout << k << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        cout << disconnected_cities[i] << " " << disconnected_cities[(i + 1) % k] << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n is the number of cities and m is the number of flights. The space complexity is O(n + m) as well.

Note: The output may vary as there can be multiple valid solutions. The given output in the example is just one possible solution.
