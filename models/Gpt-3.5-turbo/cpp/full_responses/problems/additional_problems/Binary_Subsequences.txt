To solve this problem in the most optimal way, we can use a greedy approach.

First, let's try to understand the pattern of the distinct subsequences for different values of $n$:
- For $n=1$, the minimum length bit string is "0".
- For $n=2$, the minimum length bit string is "01".
- For $n=3$, the minimum length bit string is "010".
- For $n=4$, the minimum length bit string is "0101".
- For $n=5$, the minimum length bit string is "01010".
- For $n=6$, the minimum length bit string is "010101".

From these examples, we can observe that the minimum length bit string consists of alternating "0" and "1" characters, with an additional "1" at the end if $n$ is odd.

Based on this pattern, we can create the following solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    string ans = "0";
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        ans += (i % 2 == 0) ? "0" : "1";
    }

    if (n % 2 == 1) {
        ans += "1";
    }

    cout << ans << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and will find the minimum length bit string that has exactly $n$ distinct subsequences.
