To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming.

First, we need to create a 2D table dp with size (n+1) x (k+1), initialized with all zeros. dp[i][j] will represent the number of ways to place j bishops on an i x i chessboard.

We can fill in the table using the following recurrence relation:

dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-1] * (i^2 - (i-1)^2)

The first term on the right-hand side represents the case where we don't place a bishop in the ith row. The second term represents the case where we do place a bishop in the ith row, and we multiply it by the number of valid positions for the bishop in the ith row, which is (i^2 - (i-1)^2).

Finally, the answer to the problem will be dp[n][k].

Here's the C++ code that implements this solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1000000007;

int main() {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;

    vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1, vector<int>(k+1, 0));

    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = 1;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + (dp[i-1][j-1] * (i*i - (i-1)*(i-1))) % MOD;
            dp[i][j] %= MOD;
        }
    }

    cout << dp[n][k] << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2 * k), which is efficient enough given the constraints.
