To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. 

First, we need to sort the coins in ascending order. This will help us to efficiently determine the smallest sum we cannot produce.

Next, we can iterate through the sorted coins and keep track of the maximum sum we can achieve so far. For each coin, we update the maximum sum by adding the value of the current coin.

Now, for each query, we can iterate through the coins from index $a$ to $b$ (inclusive) and check if we can form the sum $1, 2, \dots,$ or $x - 1$, where $x$ is the value of the next coin. If we cannot form a particular sum, we output it as the answer for the query.

Here's the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n, q;
    cin >> n >> q;
    
    vector<int> coins(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cin >> coins[i];
    }
    
    sort(coins.begin(), coins.end());
    
    vector<long long> prefixSum(n + 1, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + coins[i];
    }
    
    while (q--) {
        int a, b;
        cin >> a >> b;
        
        long long sum = prefixSum[b] - prefixSum[a - 1];
        
        int ans = 1;
        for (int i = a - 1; i <= b - 1; ++i) {
            if (coins[i] > ans) {
                break;
            }
            ans += coins[i];
        }
        
        cout << ans << '\n';
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of $O(n \log n + q)$, where $n$ is the number of coins and $q$ is the number of queries.
