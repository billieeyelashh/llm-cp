To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to empty the string.

Let's define a 2D array dp[i][j] where i and j represent the starting and ending indices respectively. dp[i][j] will store the number of ways to empty the substring s[i..j].

We can fill the dp array using the following recurrence relation:

dp[i][j] = dp[i][k] * dp[k+1][j] (if s[i] == s[k+1] for some k between i and j-1)

dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + dp[i+1][j] (if s[i] != s[j])

The base case is dp[i][i] = 1 for all i.

Finally, the answer will be stored in dp[0][n-1], where n is the length of the string.

Here is the C++ code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

int main() {
    string s;
    cin >> s;
    int n = s.length();

    vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n, 0));

    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        dp[i][i] = 1;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + dp[i + 1][j];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j - 1] + dp[i + 1][j] - dp[i + 1][j - 1] + MOD) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }

    cout << dp[0][n - 1] << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^3), where n is the length of the string.
