To solve this problem, we can use the mathematical formula for the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers.

1. Read the input values of $n$ and the $n-1$ numbers.
2. Initialize a variable `total` to store the sum of the missing number and the given numbers.
3. Iterate through the given numbers and subtract each number from `total`.
4. Print the value of `total`, which will be the missing number.

Here's the C++ code for the solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    
    int total = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        total += i;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        int num;
        cin >> num;
        total -= num;
    }
    
    cout << total << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of $O(n)$ since we iterate through the given numbers once.
