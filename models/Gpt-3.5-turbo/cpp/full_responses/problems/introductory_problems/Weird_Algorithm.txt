To simulate the execution of the algorithm, we can simply use a while loop until n becomes 1. Inside the loop, we check if n is even or odd and perform the corresponding operation.

Here's the C++ code for the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    std::cout << n << " ";

    while (n != 1) {
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            n /= 2;
        } else {
            n = n * 3 + 1;
        }
        std::cout << n << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:
- We start by reading the input number n from the user.
- We print the current value of n.
- We enter a while loop that continues until n becomes 1.
- Inside the loop, we check if n is even by checking if it is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator (%). If n is even, we divide it by 2.
- If n is odd, we multiply it by 3 and add 1.
- After performing the operation, we print the current value of n.
- The loop continues until n becomes 1, at which point the loop terminates and the program ends.
