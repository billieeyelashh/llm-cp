To solve this problem, we can observe that the number of ways two knights can be placed on a $k \times k$ chessboard without attacking each other is equal to the number of ways they can be placed on the board minus the number of ways they can attack each other.

Let's start with counting the total number of ways two knights can be placed on the board. For a $k \times k$ chessboard, there are $k^2$ possible positions for the first knight and $(k^2 - 1)$ possible positions for the second knight.

Now, let's count the number of ways they can attack each other. There are two types of attacks that can occur:
1. The knights are in the same row or column, but not adjacent to each other. In this case, there are $4(k-1)(k-2)$ possible positions for the second knight.
2. The knights are in an L-shape configuration. In this case, there are $2(k-2)(k-1)$ possible positions for the second knight.

Therefore, the number of ways the knights can attack each other is $4(k-1)(k-2) + 2(k-2)(k-1)$.

Finally, the number of ways two knights can be placed on a $k \times k$ chessboard without attacking each other is equal to the total number of ways minus the number of ways they can attack each other, which is $k^2(k^2 - 1) - (4(k-1)(k-2) + 2(k-2)(k-1))$.

Here is the final solution in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
        long long total_ways = 1LL * k * k * (k * k - 1);
        long long attack_ways = 2LL * (k - 2) * (k - 1) + 4LL * (k - 1) * (k - 2);
        long long non_attack_ways = total_ways - attack_ways;

        cout << non_attack_ways << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This solution iterates over the values of $k$ from $1$ to $n$, calculates the number of ways two knights can be placed on a $k \times k$ chessboard without attacking each other using the formula derived above, and prints the results.
