To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Create a frequency array to count the occurrences of each character in the input string.
2. Iterate through the frequency array and divide the count of each character by 2. This will give us the number of times we need to include that character in the palindrome.
3. Create two strings, one for the left half and one for the right half of the palindrome.
4. Iterate through the frequency array again. For each character with a count greater than 0, append it to both the left and right strings, and decrement its count by 2.
5. If there is a character with a count of 1 remaining in the frequency array, append it to the middle of the palindrome (either the left or right string).
6. Finally, concatenate the left, middle (if any), and right strings to form the palindrome.

Here is the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

string createPalindrome(string s) {
    vector<int> count(26, 0); // Frequency array for characters A-Z

    // Count the occurrences of each character
    for (char c : s) {
        count[c - 'A']++;
    }

    string left = "", right = "";
    string middle = "";

    // Iterate through the frequency array
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        // Divide the count by 2 to get the number of times to include the character in the palindrome
        int numTimes = count[i] / 2;

        // Append the character to both the left and right strings
        left += string(numTimes, 'A' + i);
        right = string(numTimes, 'A' + i) + right;

        // Decrement the count by 2
        count[i] -= (2 * numTimes);
    }

    // Check if there is a character with a count of 1 remaining
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (count[i] == 1) {
            middle = 'A' + i;
            break;
        }
    }

    // If there is no character with a count of 1, there is no solution
    if (middle.empty()) {
        return "NO SOLUTION";
    }

    // Concatenate the left, middle, and right strings
    return left + middle + right;
}

int main() {
    string s;
    cin >> s;

    cout << createPalindrome(s) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
