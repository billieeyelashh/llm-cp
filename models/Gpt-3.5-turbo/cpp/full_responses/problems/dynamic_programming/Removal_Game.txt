To solve this problem optimally, we can use dynamic programming. We'll define a 2D array dp[n][n] where dp[i][j] represents the maximum possible score the first player can achieve when considering the sublist from index i to j.

We can start filling the dp array from the bottom right corner. For each cell dp[i][j], we have two options:
1. If the first player takes the number at index i, their score will increase by x[i], and the second player will play optimally on the sublist from index i+1 to j.
2. If the first player takes the number at index j, their score will increase by x[j], and the second player will play optimally on the sublist from index i to j-1.

To calculate dp[i][j], we choose the option that maximizes the first player's score. The formula is as follows:
dp[i][j] = max(x[i] + min(dp[i+1][j-1], dp[i+2][j]), x[j] + min(dp[i+1][j-1], dp[i][j-2]))

Finally, the maximum possible score for the first player will be stored in dp[0][n-1].

Here's the C++ code that implements this solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    vector<int> x(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> x[i];
    }

    vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n));
    for (int len = 1; len <= n; len++) {
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; i++) {
            int j = i + len - 1;
            if (i == j) {
                dp[i][j] = x[i];
            } else {
                int option1 = x[i] + min(dp[i + 1][j - 1], dp[i + 2][j]);
                int option2 = x[j] + min(dp[i + 1][j - 1], dp[i][j - 2]);
                dp[i][j] = max(option1, option2);
            }
        }
    }

    cout << dp[0][n - 1] << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(n^2).
