To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will iterate through the cubes, and for each cube, we will check if it can be placed on top of an existing tower. If not, we will start a new tower.

Here is the C++ code to solve the problem:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    vector<int> cubes(n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> cubes[i];
    }

    vector<int> towers;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int cube = cubes[i];

        // Find the first tower where the cube can be placed
        auto it = lower_bound(towers.begin(), towers.end(), cube);

        // If no such tower exists, start a new tower
        if (it == towers.end()) {
            towers.push_back(cube);
        } 
        // Otherwise, update the tower with the smallest possible cube size
        else {
            *it = cube;
        }
    }

    cout << towers.size() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The code reads the input, stores the cubes in a vector, and initializes an empty vector `towers` to store the sizes of the cubes at the top of each tower.

Next, it iterates through the cubes and for each cube, it finds the first tower where the cube can be placed using the `lower_bound` function. If no such tower exists, a new tower is started by adding the cube size to the `towers` vector. If a tower is found, the cube size is updated to the smallest possible value.

Finally, the code prints the size of the `towers` vector, which represents the minimum number of towers required.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the number of cubes.
