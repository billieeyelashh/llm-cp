To calculate the area of a polygon, we can use the Shoelace formula. The Shoelace formula states that the area of a polygon with vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn) is given by:

area = abs((x1*y2 + x2*y3 + ... + xn*y1) - (y1*x2 + y2*x3 + ... + yn*x1)) / 2

We can implement this formula in C++ as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    vector<int> x(n);
    vector<int> y(n);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> x[i] >> y[i];
    }

    int area = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        area += x[i] * y[(i + 1) % n];
        area -= y[i] * x[(i + 1) % n];
    }

    cout << abs(area) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this solution, we first read the number of vertices, and then we read the coordinates of each vertex. We store the x and y coordinates in two separate vectors.

Next, we iterate over each vertex and calculate the contribution to the area using the Shoelace formula. We add the product of the current x-coordinate and the next y-coordinate, and subtract the product of the current y-coordinate and the next x-coordinate.

Finally, we take the absolute value of the calculated area and print it as the output.
