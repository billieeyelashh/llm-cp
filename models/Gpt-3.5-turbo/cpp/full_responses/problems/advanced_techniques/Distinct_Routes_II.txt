To solve this problem, we can use a modified Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from room 1 to room n. We will keep track of the minimum cost to reach each room, as well as the previous room in the optimal path.

Here is the step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input values for n, m, and k.
2. Initialize an adjacency list to store the teleporters. For each teleporter, add the destination room to the list of neighbors for the starting room.
3. Initialize an array "cost" of size n, where cost[i] represents the minimum cost to reach room i from room 1. Initialize all elements of the array to a large value, except for cost[1] which is set to 0.
4. Initialize an array "prev" of size n, where prev[i] represents the previous room in the optimal path to reach room i from room 1. Initialize all elements of the array to -1.
5. Create a priority queue to store the rooms to be visited. Each element in the priority queue will be a pair (room, cost), where room is the current room and cost is the minimum cost to reach that room.
6. Push the initial room 1 with cost 0 into the priority queue.
7. While the priority queue is not empty:
     - Pop the room with the smallest cost from the priority queue.
     - For each neighbor of the current room:
         - If the cost to reach the neighbor through the current room is smaller than the current cost stored in the "cost" array:
             - Update the "cost" array with the new cost.
             - Update the "prev" array with the current room as the previous room for the neighbor.
             - Push the neighbor into the priority queue with the new cost.
8. After the Dijkstra's algorithm finishes, check if it is possible to play the game for k days:
     - If the cost[n] is equal to infinity or the previous room for room n is still -1, print -1 and return.
9. To find the minimum number of coins you have to pay if you play optimally, calculate the total cost by multiplying the cost[n] by k.
10. To print the k route descriptions, initialize a vector "route" to store the rooms in each day's route.
11. Starting from room n, trace back the optimal path using the "prev" array and add each room to the "route" vector.
12. Reverse the "route" vector to get the correct order.
13. Print the minimum number of coins and then print each route in the "route" vector.

Here is the final solution in C++:

    }

                prev[neighbor] = room;
                pq.push({new_cost, neighbor});
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (cost[n] == INF || prev[n] == -1) {
