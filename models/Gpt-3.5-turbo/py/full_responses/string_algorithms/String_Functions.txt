To solve this problem, we can use the Z-algorithm to calculate the values of the $z$ function and then use those values to calculate the values of the $\pi$ function.

The Z-algorithm is a linear time algorithm that calculates the longest common prefix between a string and all of its suffixes. We can use this algorithm to calculate the values of the $z$ function.

Here is the Python code to calculate the values of the $z$ function:

```python
def calculate_z_function(s):
    n = len(s)
    z = [0] * n
    l = r = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i <= r:
            z[i] = min(r - i + 1, z[i - l])
        while i + z[i] < n and s[i + z[i]] == s[z[i]]:
            z[i] += 1
        if i + z[i] - 1 > r:
            l = i
            r = i + z[i] - 1
    return z
```

Now that we have the values of the $z$ function, we can calculate the values of the $\pi$ function using the following formula:

$$\pi(i) = \max(\pi(i - 1) - 1, z(i))$$

Here is the Python code to calculate the values of the $\pi$ function:

```python
def calculate_pi_function(z):
    n = len(z)
    pi = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        pi[i] = max(pi[i - 1] - 1, z[i])
    return pi
```

Finally, we can put it all together and print the values of the $z$ function and the $\pi$ function:

```python
s = input().strip()
z = calculate_z_function(s)
pi = calculate_pi_function(z)
print(' '.join(map(str, z)))
print(' '.join(map(str, pi)))
```

This solution has a time complexity of $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string.
