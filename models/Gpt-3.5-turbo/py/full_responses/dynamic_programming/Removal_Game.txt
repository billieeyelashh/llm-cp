To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to find the optimal solution.

Let's define a function $DP[i][j]$ that represents the maximum possible score for the first player when considering the sublist from index $i$ to index $j$ (inclusive).

We can compute $DP[i][j]$ using the following recurrence relation:
$$
DP[i][j] = \max(x[i] + \min(DP[i+2][j], DP[i+1][j-1]), x[j] + \min(DP[i+1][j-1], DP[i][j-2]))
$$

The base case is when $i = j$, in which case $DP[i][j] = x[i]$.

To implement this in Python:

```python
n = int(input())
x = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Initialize DP table with zeros
DP = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

# Base case
for i in range(n):
    DP[i][i] = x[i]

# Fill the DP table
for gap in range(1, n):
    for i in range(n - gap):
        j = i + gap
        DP[i][j] = max(
            x[i] + min(DP[i + 2][j], DP[i + 1][j - 1]),
            x[j] + min(DP[i + 1][j - 1], DP[i][j - 2])
        )

# The maximum possible score for the first player is DP[0][n-1]
print(DP[0][n - 1])
```

The time complexity of this solution is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the size of the list.
