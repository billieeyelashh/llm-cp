To find the minimum number of steps required to make the number equal to 0, we can follow the following approach:

1. Initialize a variable `steps` to 0.
2. While `n` is greater than 0, do the following steps:
   - Find the smallest digit in `n`.
   - Subtract this smallest digit from `n`.
   - Increment `steps` by 1.
3. Print the value of `steps`.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

```python
n = int(input())

steps = 0
while n > 0:
    smallest_digit = min([int(digit) for digit in str(n)])
    n -= smallest_digit
    steps += 1

print(steps)
```

This solution iterates through the digits of `n` and subtracts the smallest digit in each step until `n` becomes 0. The number of steps taken is then printed as the output.
