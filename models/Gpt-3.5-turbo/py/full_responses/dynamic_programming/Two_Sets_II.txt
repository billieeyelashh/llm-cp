To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming approach. Let's denote the total sum of numbers $1,2,...,n$ as $S$. We need to find the number of ways to divide these numbers into two sets with equal sum, which means each set should have a sum of $S/2$.

Let's define a 2D array dp[n+1][S+1], where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to divide the numbers $1,2,...,i$ into two sets such that the first set has a sum of j.

We can fill this array using the following recurrence relation:
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-i]

The first term on the right-hand side represents the number of ways to divide the numbers $1,2,...,i-1$ into two sets with a sum of j (without including the number i).
The second term represents the number of ways to divide the numbers $1,2,...,i-1$ into two sets with a sum of j - i (including the number i).

Finally, the answer we are looking for is dp[n][S/2] modulo $10^9+7$.

Here is the Python implementation:

```python
def count_divisions(n):
    S = n*(n+1)//2
    if S % 2 != 0:
        return 0
    
    target_sum = S // 2
    mod = int(1e9) + 7

    dp = [[0] * (target_sum + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(target_sum + 1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]
            if j >= i:
                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - i]
            dp[i][j] %= mod

    return dp[n][target_sum]

# Reading input
n = int(input())

# Calling the function and printing the result
print(count_divisions(n))
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n*S), where n is the input number and S is the sum of numbers $1,2,...,n$.
