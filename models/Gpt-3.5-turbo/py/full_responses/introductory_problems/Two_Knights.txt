To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways two knights can be placed on a chessboard of size $k \times k$, such that they do not attack each other.

Observations:
1. Knights attack each other if they are in positions where one knight can directly attack the other knight. In other words, if they are either in the same row, same column, or at a distance of $\sqrt{5}$ in the diagonal direction.
2. For a knight in position $(i, j)$, the number of cells it can attack is 2 if $i+j$ is even and 0 if $i+j$ is odd.

Approach:
We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. Let's define $dp[i]$ as the number of ways two knights can be placed on a $i \times i$ chessboard such that they do not attack each other.

Base cases:
$dp[1] = 0$ (There is only one cell, so no way to place two knights)

Recursive relation:
For $i > 1$, $dp[i] = dp[i-2] + 4 \cdot (\text{sum of } dp[j] \text{ for all } j < i-1)$

Explanation of the recursive relation:
- $dp[i-2]$ represents the number of ways two knights can be placed on a $(i-2) \times (i-2)$ chessboard without attacking each other. We can add two knights in the remaining 2 rows/columns.
- For each $(j, k)$ cell in the $(i-2) \times (i-2)$ chessboard, we can add two knights in the remaining 2 rows/columns by considering all possible positions of the knights in the remaining 2 rows/columns. There are 4 possible positions, hence the factor of 4.

Python code:

```python
n = int(input())
dp = [0] * (n+1)
dp[1] = 0

for i in range(2, n+1):
    dp[i] = dp[i-2] + 4 * sum(dp[j] for j in range(i-1))

for i in range(1, n+1):
    print(dp[i])
```

This solution has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ and will work efficiently for the given constraints.
