To solve this problem, we can use the property of the sum of consecutive numbers. The sum of all numbers from 1 to n can be calculated using the formula n * (n+1) / 2.

We can calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to n using this formula and subtract the sum of the given (n-1) numbers. The difference will be the missing number.

Here is the Python implementation:

```python
n = int(input())
numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))

total_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
given_sum = sum(numbers)

missing_number = total_sum - given_sum
print(missing_number)
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and will work efficiently within the given constraints.
