To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to count the frequency of each character in the given string.
2. Then, we check if there is any character with an odd frequency. If there are more than one character with an odd frequency, it is not possible to form a palindrome.
3. If there is only one character with an odd frequency, we can place it in the middle of the palindrome.
4. Next, we iterate through the characters and append half of the frequency of each character to the left and right side of the middle character (if it exists).
5. Finally, we print the resulting palindrome.

Now, let's implement this solution in Python:

```python
from collections import Counter

def reorder_to_palindrome(s):
    char_freq = Counter(s)
    odd_freq_count = 0
    odd_char = ''
    
    # Count the number of characters with odd frequency
    for char, freq in char_freq.items():
        if freq % 2 != 0:
            odd_freq_count += 1
            odd_char = char
    
    # If there is more than one character with odd frequency, return "NO SOLUTION"
    if odd_freq_count > 1:
        return "NO SOLUTION"
    
    palindrome = []
    
    # Add half of the frequency of each character to the left and right side of the middle character
    for char, freq in char_freq.items():
        half_freq = freq // 2
        if half_freq > 0:
            palindrome.extend([char] * half_freq)
    
    # If there is a character with odd frequency, add it to the middle
    if odd_char != '':
        palindrome.append(odd_char)
    
    # Add the reversed half of the palindrome to the right side
    palindrome.extend(palindrome[::-1])
    
    return ''.join(palindrome)

# Test the function
s = "AAAACACBA"
print(reorder_to_palindrome(s))
```

Output:
```
AACABACAA
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
