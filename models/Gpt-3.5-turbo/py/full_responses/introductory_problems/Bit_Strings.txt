To solve this problem, we can use the concept of binary numbers. A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system, which consists of only two digits: 0 and 1.

We need to find the number of bit strings of length $n$. Since each bit can be either 0 or 1, there are two choices for each bit. Therefore, the total number of bit strings of length $n$ is $2^n$.

To calculate $2^n$ efficiently, we can use the exponentiation by squaring algorithm. This algorithm reduces the number of multiplications required to compute a power by dividing the exponent in half at each step.

Here is the Python solution using the exponentiation by squaring algorithm:

```python
MOD = int(1e9) + 7

def calculate_bit_strings(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        half = calculate_bit_strings(n // 2)
        return (half * half) % MOD
    else:
        half = calculate_bit_strings(n // 2)
        return (half * half * 2) % MOD

n = int(input())
result = calculate_bit_strings(n)
print(result)
```

Explanation of the solution:
- We define a function `calculate_bit_strings` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of bit strings of length `n`.
- If `n` is 0, we return 1 because there is only one possible bit string of length 0, which is an empty string.
- If `n` is even, we recursively calculate the number of bit strings of length `n // 2` and square it. We take the result modulo `MOD` to prevent overflow.
- If `n` is odd, we do the same as above but also multiply the result by 2. Again, we take the result modulo `MOD`.
- Finally, we read the input value of `n`, calculate the number of bit strings using the `calculate_bit_strings` function, and print the result.
