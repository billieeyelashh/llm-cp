To count the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a number $n$, we need to determine the power of 10 in the factorial.

Approach:
1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0.
2. Iterate while $n$ is greater than or equal to 5.
3. Divide $n$ by 5 and add the result to `count`.
4. Divide $n$ by 5 again and update `count` with the new result.
5. Print `count`.

Python Solution:

```python
n = int(input())
count = 0

while n >= 5:
    n //= 5
    count += n

print(count)
```

This solution has a time complexity of $O(\log n)$ as we divide $n$ by 5 in each iteration until $n$ becomes less than 5.
