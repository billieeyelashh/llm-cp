To solve this problem, we need to observe a pattern in the number spiral. 

We can see that the number at row $y$ and column $x$ is determined by the following formula:
\[ \text{{number}} = \max(y, x)^2 - (\max(y, x) - 1) + \text{{diff}} \]
where $\text{{diff}}$ is the difference between $\max(y, x)$ and the smaller of $y$ and $x$. 

Now, let's implement this solution in Python:

```python
# Function to find the number in row y and column x
def number_in_spiral(y, x):
    diff = abs(y - x)
    max_value = max(y, x)
    return max_value ** 2 - (max_value - 1) + diff

# Read the number of tests
t = int(input())

# Iterate through each test case
for _ in range(t):
    # Read the values of y and x
    y, x = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Print the number in row y and column x
    print(number_in_spiral(y, x))
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(1) as we are directly calculating the number in the spiral using a simple formula.
