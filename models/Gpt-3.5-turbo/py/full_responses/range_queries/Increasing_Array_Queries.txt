To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We will iterate over the array from left to right, keeping track of the minimum number of operations required to make each element greater than or equal to the previous element.

Here is the solution in Python:

```python
n, q = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# dp[i] stores the minimum number of operations required to make a[i] greater than or equal to a[i-1]
dp = [0] * n

for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i] >= a[i-1]:
        dp[i] = dp[i-1]
    else:
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + a[i-1] - a[i]

# Process the queries
for _ in range(q):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    # The minimum number of operations for the subarray from position a to position b is dp[b-1] - dp[a-1]
    print(dp[b-1] - dp[a-1])
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n + q), which is efficient enough for the given constraints.
