To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. We will start from the post office and explore the streets one by one, making sure to visit each street exactly once.

Here is our solution in Python:

```python
def dfs(node, visited, graph, route):
    visited[node] = True
    route.append(node)

    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            dfs(neighbor, visited, graph, route)

    return route

def find_route(n, m, streets):
    # Initialize the graph as an adjacency list
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]  # +1 for 1-based indexing

    # Build the graph from the input streets
    for a, b in streets:
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)

    # Initialize visited array
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)

    # Start the DFS from the post office (node 1)
    route = dfs(1, visited, graph, [])

    # If not all crossings were visited, it's impossible to find a valid route
    if len(route) != n:
        return "IMPOSSIBLE"

    # Otherwise, return the route as a space-separated string
    return ' '.join(map(str, route))

# Read input
n, m = map(int, input().split())
streets = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Find and print the route
print(find_route(n, m, streets))
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where n is the number of crossings and m is the number of streets.
