To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the start position to one of the boundary squares. We will also keep track of the path taken during the BFS traversal.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Read the input values for `n` and `m`, and initialize an empty list `maze` to store the labyrinth.

2. Read the labyrinth map from input and store it in `maze`.

3. Initialize a boolean variable `possible` as False, which will be used to check if a valid path exists.

4. Initialize a 2D boolean array `visited` of size `n x m` to keep track of visited cells. Initialize all cells to False.

5. Initialize a 2D character array `path` of size `n x m` to store the path taken during the BFS traversal. Initialize all cells to '.'.

6. Initialize a queue `queue` and enqueue the starting position (A) into the queue.

7. Run a BFS traversal while the queue is not empty:

   7.1 Dequeue a position `(x, y)` from the queue.

   7.2 If `(x, y)` is a boundary square (i.e., on the edge of the labyrinth), set `possible` to True and break from the loop.

   7.3 For each valid adjacent position `(nx, ny)` of `(x, y)` (i.e., not out of bounds and not a wall):

       7.3.1 If `(nx, ny)` is not visited and does not contain a monster (M), enqueue `(nx, ny)` into the queue.

       7.3.2 Mark `(nx, ny)` as visited and set `path[nx][ny]` to the direction of `(x, y)`.

8. If `possible` is True, print "YES".

9. If `possible` is True, print the length of the path (number of steps taken).

10. If `possible` is True, backtrace the path from the boundary square to the start position using the `path` array and print the directions taken.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
from collections import deque

# Read input values
n, m = map(int, input().split())

# Read labyrinth map
maze = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]

# Initialize variables
possible = False
visited = [[False] * m for _ in range(n)]
path = [['.'] * m for _ in range(n)]
directions = {'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}
start_pos = None

# Find the starting position
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if maze[i][j] == 'A':
            start_pos = (i, j)
            break

# Run BFS traversal
queue = deque([start_pos])
visited[start_pos[0]][start_pos[1]] = True

while queue:
    x, y = queue.popleft()

    # Check if it's a boundary square
    if x == 0 or x == n - 1 or y == 0 or y == m - 1:
        possible = True
        break

    # Check adjacent positions
    for dx, dy in directions.values():
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

        # Check if position is valid
        if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and not visited[nx][ny] and maze[nx][ny] != '#':
            queue.append((nx, ny))
            visited[nx][ny] = True
            path[nx][ny] = next(dir for dir, (ddx, ddy) in directions.items() if dx == ddx and dy == ddy)

# Print the result
if possible:
    print("YES")
    steps = sum(row.count('.') for row in path)
    print(steps)
    x, y = next((i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if maze[i][j] == 'A')
    while path[x][y] != '.':
        print(path[x][y], end='')
        dx, dy = directions[path[x][y]]
        x, y = x + dx, y + dy
else:
    print("NO")
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m) since we visit each cell at most once. The space complexity is also O(n * m) to store the visited cells and path arrays.
