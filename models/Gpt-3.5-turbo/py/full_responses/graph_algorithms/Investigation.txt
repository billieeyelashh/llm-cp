To find the minimum price, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. We will maintain a priority queue to store the cities and their minimum costs. Initially, the cost of the source city (Syrjälä) is 0, and the cost of all other cities is infinity. We will process the cities in order of their costs and update the minimum cost for each neighbor city.

To find the number of minimum-price routes, we will also maintain an array to store the number of minimum-cost routes to each city. Initially, the number of routes to the source city is 1, and the number of routes to all other cities is 0. Whenever we find a new minimum cost for a city, we will update the number of routes to that city by adding the number of routes to the previous city.

To find the minimum and maximum number of flights in a minimum-price route, we will maintain two arrays: one to store the minimum number of flights to reach each city with the minimum cost, and the other to store the maximum number of flights to reach each city with the minimum cost. Initially, the minimum and maximum number of flights to the source city is 0. For each neighbor city, we will update the minimum and maximum number of flights based on the minimum and maximum number of flights to the previous city.

Here is the Python solution:

```python
import heapq

def dijkstra(n, m, flights):
    # Initialize the data structures
    costs = [float('inf')] * n
    routes = [0] * n
    min_flights = [float('inf')] * n
    max_flights = [0] * n
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]

    # Build the adjacency list representation of the graph
    for a, b, c in flights:
        graph[a-1].append((b-1, c))

    # Dijkstra's algorithm
    queue = [(0, 0)]  # (cost, city)
    costs[0] = 0
    routes[0] = 1
    min_flights[0] = 0
    max_flights[0] = 0

    while queue:
        cost, city = heapq.heappop(queue)

        if cost > costs[city]:
            continue

        for neighbor, flight_cost in graph[city]:
            new_cost = cost + flight_cost

            if new_cost < costs[neighbor]:
                costs[neighbor] = new_cost
                routes[neighbor] = routes[city]
                min_flights[neighbor] = min_flights[city] + 1
                max_flights[neighbor] = max_flights[city] + 1
                heapq.heappush(queue, (new_cost, neighbor))
            elif new_cost == costs[neighbor]:
                routes[neighbor] = (routes[neighbor] + routes[city]) % (10**9 + 7)
                min_flights[neighbor] = min(min_flights[neighbor], min_flights[city] + 1)
                max_flights[neighbor] = max(max_flights[neighbor], max_flights[city] + 1)

    return costs[n-1], routes[n-1], min_flights[n-1], max_flights[n-1]

# Read the input
n, m = map(int, input().split())
flights = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]

# Call the dijkstra function and print the results
min_price, num_routes, min_num_flights, max_num_flights = dijkstra(n, m, flights)
print(min_price, num_routes, min_num_flights, max_num_flights)
```

This solution has a time complexity of O((n + m) log n) because Dijkstra's algorithm has a time complexity of O((n + m) log n).
