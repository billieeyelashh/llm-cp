To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. We will maintain a visited array to keep track of the squares that have been visited, and a moves array to store the sequence of moves.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def is_valid_move(x, y):
    return 1 <= x <= 8 and 1 <= y <= 8

def dfs(x, y, count, visited, moves):
    # Mark the current square as visited
    visited[x][y] = True
    
    # Add the current square to the moves array
    moves.append((x, y))
    
    # If all squares have been visited, return True
    if count == 64:
        return True
    
    # Possible knight moves
    dx = [2, 1, -1, -2, -2, -1, 1, 2]
    dy = [1, 2, 2, 1, -1, -2, -2, -1]
    
    # Try all possible moves from the current square
    for i in range(8):
        new_x = x + dx[i]
        new_y = y + dy[i]
        
        # Check if the move is valid and the square has not been visited yet
        if is_valid_move(new_x, new_y) and not visited[new_x][new_y]:
            # Recursive call to explore the next square
            if dfs(new_x, new_y, count+1, visited, moves):
                return True
    
    # Backtrack: remove the last move from the moves array and mark the current square as unvisited
    moves.pop()
    visited[x][y] = False
    
    return False

# Read the input
x, y = map(int, input().split())

# Create the visited array
visited = [[False] * 9 for _ in range(9)]

# Create the moves array
moves = []

# Call the DFS function to find the sequence of moves
dfs(x, y, 1, visited, moves)

# Print the moves array
for move in moves:
    print(move[0], move[1], end=' ')
```

The code starts by defining a helper function `is_valid_move` to check if a move is valid (i.e., the destination square is within the chessboard).

The main `dfs` function performs a depth-first search starting from the given position `(x, y)`. It takes as input the current position, the number of squares visited so far, the visited array, and the moves array. It first marks the current square as visited and adds it to the moves array. If all squares have been visited, it returns `True` to indicate success. Otherwise, it tries all possible knight moves from the current square and recursively calls itself to explore the next square. If a recursive call returns `True`, it means a valid sequence of moves has been found, so it also returns `True`. If none of the moves from the current square lead to a valid solution, the function backtracks by removing the last move from the moves array and marking the current square as unvisited.

Finally, the code reads the input, creates the visited array and the moves array, and calls the `dfs` function to find the sequence of moves. It then prints the moves array as the output.
