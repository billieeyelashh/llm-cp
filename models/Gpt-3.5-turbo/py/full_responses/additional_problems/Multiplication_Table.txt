To solve this problem, we can use binary search to find the middle element in the sorted multiplication table. 

First, we initialize two variables, `low` and `high`, to represent the range of possible values for the middle element. `low` is set to 1, representing the minimum value in the multiplication table, and `high` is set to `n * n`, representing the maximum value.

Then, we enter a while loop that continues until `low` becomes greater than `high`. In each iteration of the loop, we calculate the average of `low` and `high`, and update `mid` to store the floor value of the average.

Next, we count the number of elements less than or equal to `mid` in the multiplication table. We do this by iterating through each row from 1 to `n`, and adding the minimum value between `mid` divided by the row index and `n` to a variable `count`.

If `count` is less than or equal to `(n * n) // 2`, it means that `mid` is not the middle element. In this case, we update `low` to be `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `mid` could be the middle element, so we update `high` to be `mid - 1`.

Once the while loop exits, we print the value of `low`, which represents the middle element in the sorted multiplication table.

Here is the Python solution:

```python
n = int(input())
low = 1
high = n * n

while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        count += min(mid // i, n)
    
    if count <= (n * n) // 2:
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid - 1

print(low)
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(log(n^2)), which is equivalent to O(log(n)).
