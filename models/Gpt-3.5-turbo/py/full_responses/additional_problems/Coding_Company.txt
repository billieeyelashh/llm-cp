To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let's define a dp array where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to divide the first i coders into teams such that the sum of the penalties is at most j.

We can initialize dp[0][0] = 1, as there is only one way to divide zero coders.

Now, let's iterate over the coders from 1 to n and calculate dp[i][j] based on the previous values of dp.

For each coder i, we have two options:
1. Include coder i in a team: In this case, we need to find the minimum and maximum skill levels among the coders in the current team. Let's say the minimum skill level is min_skill and the maximum skill level is max_skill. Then, the penalty for including coder i in the team would be max_skill - min_skill. We can update dp[i][j] by adding dp[i-1][j - (max_skill - min_skill)] to it.
2. Exclude coder i from any team: In this case, we don't incur any penalty. We can simply update dp[i][j] by adding dp[i-1][j] to it.

Finally, the answer to the problem will be the sum of dp[n][0] to dp[n][x].

Here is the Python code for the solution:

```python
MOD = int(1e9) + 7

def solve(n, x, skills):
    dp = [[0] * (x + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        min_skill = max_skill = skills[i - 1]
        for j in range(i, 0, -1):
            min_skill = min(min_skill, skills[j - 1])
            max_skill = max(max_skill, skills[j - 1])
            for k in range(max_skill - min_skill, x + 1):
                dp[i][k] = (dp[i][k] + dp[j - 1][k - (max_skill - min_skill)]) % MOD

        for j in range(x + 1):
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j]) % MOD

    return sum(dp[n]) % MOD

# Read input
n, x = map(int, input().split())
skills = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Solve the problem
result = solve(n, x, skills)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^3 * x) and a space complexity of O(n * x).
