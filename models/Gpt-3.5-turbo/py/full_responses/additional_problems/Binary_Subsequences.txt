To solve this problem, we can use the concept of binary representation. 

If we observe carefully, for every distinct subsequence, there will be a unique binary string formed. The length of this binary string will be equal to the length of the longest subsequence present in it.

So, to find the minimum length bit string that has exactly n distinct subsequences, we need to find the length of the longest subsequence possible using n distinct subsequences.

Let's find the length of the longest subsequence using n distinct subsequences:
- Take the binary representation of n.
- Count the number of bits in the binary representation.
- The length of the longest subsequence will be equal to the number of bits.

Finally, we can construct the required bit string by starting with '1' followed by '0's for the remaining length - 1.

Here is the Python solution:

```python
def solve(n):
    # Find the length of the longest subsequence
    length = len(bin(n)) - 2

    # Construct the bit string
    ans = '1' + '0' * (length - 1)

    return ans

# Read the input
n = int(input())

# Call the solve function and print the result
print(solve(n))
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(log n) as we are finding the number of bits in the binary representation of n.
