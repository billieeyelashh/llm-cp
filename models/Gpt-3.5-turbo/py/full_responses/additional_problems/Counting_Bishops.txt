To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Let's define a 2D array `dp` of size `(n+1) x (k+1)` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to place `j` bishops on an `i x i` chessboard.

We can start by initializing the base cases:

- For `i = 0`, `dp[0][j] = 0` since there are no rows on the chessboard.
- For `j = 0`, `dp[i][0] = 1` since there are no bishops to be placed.

Now, let's fill in the rest of the `dp` array using the following recurrence relation:

- `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-1] * (i-1)`, which represents two cases:
  1. The `j` bishops are placed in the first `i-1` rows, so we can simply copy the value from `dp[i-1][j]`.
  2. The `j-1` bishops are placed in the first `i-1` rows, and the `j`th bishop is placed in the `i`th row. We multiply by `(i-1)` to account for the number of possible positions for the `j`th bishop in the `i`th row.

Finally, the answer will be `dp[n][k]`.

Here's the Python code that implements the above approach:

```python
MOD = int(1e9+7)

def count_ways(n, k):
    dp = [[0] * (k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
    for i in range(n+1):
        dp[i][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, k+1):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-1] * (i-1)
            dp[i][j] %= MOD
    return dp[n][k]

# Read input
n, k = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate and print result
result = count_ways(n, k)
print(result)
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2 * k), which is efficient enough to handle the given constraints.
