To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We will start the DFS from any city and keep track of the maximum distance from the starting city to any other city. If this maximum distance is less than or equal to $d$, then we can have offices in all cities. Otherwise, we will select the city with the maximum distance and start a new DFS from that city.

Here is the Python code for this solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def dfs(node, parent, graph, distance, max_distance):
    distance[node] = distance[parent] + 1
    max_distance[0] = max(max_distance[0], distance[node])
    
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor != parent:
            dfs(neighbor, node, graph, distance, max_distance)

def solve(n, d, roads):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in roads:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    distance = [0] * (n+1)
    max_distance = [0]
    
    dfs(1, 0, graph, distance, max_distance)
    
    if max_distance[0] <= d:
        return (n, range(1, n+1))
    
    max_node = distance.index(max(distance))
    
    distance = [0] * (n+1)
    max_distance = [0]
    
    dfs(max_node, 0, graph, distance, max_distance)
    
    offices = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if distance[i] >= d]
    return (len(offices), offices)

# Read input
n, d = map(int, input().split())
roads = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n-1)]

# Solve the problem
result = solve(n, d, roads)

# Print the result
print(result[0])
print(*result[1])
```

The time complexity of this solution is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of cities. This is because we perform a DFS twice, once from any city and once from the city with the maximum distance. The DFS visits each city once, so the overall time complexity is linear in the number of cities.
