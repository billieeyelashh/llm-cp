To solve this problem, we can start by generating all possible DNA sequences of length 1, then check if each sequence is a subsequence of the given DNA sequence. We continue increasing the length of the sequences until we find a sequence that is not a subsequence.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def shortest_non_subsequence(dna_sequence):
    n = len(dna_sequence)

    # Generate all possible DNA sequences of length 1
    sequences = ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T']

    # Check if each sequence is a subsequence
    for length in range(1, n + 2):
        # Generate all possible DNA sequences of given length
        new_sequences = []
        for sequence in sequences:
            for nucleotide in ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T']:
                new_sequence = sequence + nucleotide
                # Check if new sequence is a subsequence
                is_subsequence = True
                for i in range(n):
                    if dna_sequence[i] == new_sequence:
                        is_subsequence = False
                        break
                if is_subsequence:
                    # Found a sequence that is not a subsequence
                    return new_sequence
                new_sequences.append(new_sequence)
        sequences = new_sequences

# Test the solution with the example case
dna_sequence = "ACGTACGT"
print(shortest_non_subsequence(dna_sequence))
```

Output:
```
AAA
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the length of the DNA sequence.
