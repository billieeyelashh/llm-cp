To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to reorder the characters of the string.

Let's define a 2D array, dp, where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to reorder the first i characters of the string such that the last character is j.

We can initialize dp[1][j] = 1 for each character j in the string. This is because there is only one way to reorder a single character.

Then, for i = 2 to n, and for each character j in the string, we can calculate dp[i][j] as the sum of dp[i-1][k] for all characters k in the string, except for j. This is because we can append j to any valid string ending with k, as long as j and k are different.

Finally, the total number of ways to reorder the entire string is the sum of dp[n][j] for all characters j in the string.

Here's the Python implementation:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def count_ways(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [[0] * 26 for _ in range(n+1)]

    # Initialize dp[1][j] = 1 for each character j
    for j in range(26):
        dp[1][j] = 1

    for i in range(2, n+1):
        for j in range(26):
            for k in range(26):
                if j != k:
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][k]) % MOD

    total_ways = 0
    for j in range(26):
        total_ways = (total_ways + dp[n][j]) % MOD

    return total_ways

# Test the solution with the provided example
s = 'aabc'
print(count_ways(s))
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) and the space complexity is O(n).
