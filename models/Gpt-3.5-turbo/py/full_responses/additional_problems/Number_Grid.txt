To solve this problem optimally, we can observe that the value at square (y, x) is the maximum of y and x.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

```python
y, x = map(int, input().split())
print(max(y, x))
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(1) as it simply calculates the maximum of two integers.
