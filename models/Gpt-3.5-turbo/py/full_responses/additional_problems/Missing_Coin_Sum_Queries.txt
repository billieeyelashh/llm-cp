To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a greedy approach. 

We will sort the coins in ascending order. Then, for each query, we will iterate through the coins from $a$ to $b$ and keep track of the smallest sum we cannot produce.

Let's denote the smallest sum we cannot produce as $smallest\_sum$. Initially, $smallest\_sum$ is set to 1.

For each coin $x_i$ in the range $a$ to $b$, if $x_i$ is greater than $smallest\_sum$, we have found the answer for the current query and we can break the loop. Otherwise, we update $smallest\_sum$ by adding $x_i$ to it.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
# Read input
n, q = map(int, input().split())
coins = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Sort the coins in ascending order
coins.sort()

# Process each query
for _ in range(q):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Initialize the smallest sum
    smallest_sum = 1
    
    # Iterate through the coins from a to b
    for i in range(a-1, b):
        if coins[i] > smallest_sum:
            # Found the answer for the current query
            print(smallest_sum)
            break
        else:
            # Update smallest_sum
            smallest_sum += coins[i]
    else:
        # If the loop completes without finding an answer, the smallest sum is the sum of all coins
        print(smallest_sum)
```

The time complexity of this solution is $O(n \log n + q)$, where $n$ is the number of coins and $q$ is the number of queries. This is because we need to sort the coins, which takes $O(n \log n)$ time, and then process each query in $O(1)$ time.
