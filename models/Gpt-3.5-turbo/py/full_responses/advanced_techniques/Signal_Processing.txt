To solve this problem, we can iterate through the signal and calculate the sum of products for each mask position.

Here's the step-by-step solution in Python:

```python
def process_signal(signal, mask):
    n = len(signal)
    m = len(mask)
    
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through each mask position
    for i in range(n + m - 1):
        # Calculate the starting and ending indices for signal
        start = max(0, i - m + 1)
        end = min(i + 1, n)
        
        # Calculate the sum of products for the current mask position
        sum_of_products = sum(signal[j] * mask[i - j] for j in range(start, end))
        
        result.append(sum_of_products)
    
    return result

# Read input
n, m = map(int, input().split())
signal = list(map(int, input().split()))
mask = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Call the function to process the signal
output = process_signal(signal, mask)

# Print the output
print(*output)
```

The `process_signal` function takes the signal and mask as input and returns a list of the sum of products for each mask position. The main logic is in the loop where we calculate the starting and ending indices for the signal based on the current mask position. Then, we use a list comprehension to calculate the sum of products using the `signal` and `mask` values at the corresponding indices. Finally, we append the sum to the result list.

Note: This solution has a time complexity of O((n + m) * min(n, m)), where n and m are the lengths of the signal and mask respectively.
