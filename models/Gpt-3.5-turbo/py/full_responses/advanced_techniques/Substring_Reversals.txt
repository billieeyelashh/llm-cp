We can solve this problem by iteratively applying the operations one by one. We start with the given string and for each operation, we reverse the substring specified by $a$ and $b$.

Here is the Python solution:

```python
# Read input
n, m = map(int, input().split())
s = input()

# Apply each operation
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    # Reverse the substring from position a to position b
    s = s[:a-1] + s[a-1:b][::-1] + s[b:]

# Print the final string
print(s)
```

The time complexity of this solution is $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the length of the string and $m$ is the number of operations.
