To count the number of Eulerian subgraphs, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Let's define a function $f(v, d)$, where $v$ is the current node and $d$ is the degree of node $v$ in the current subgraph. The value of $f(v, d)$ represents the number of Eulerian subgraphs that can be formed starting from node $v$ with degree $d$.

We can calculate $f(v, d)$ using the following recurrence relation:
$$f(v, d) = \sum_{i=0}^{d} \binom{d}{i} f(u, i) \cdot f(v, d-i)$$
where $u$ are the neighbors of $v$.

The base case for this recurrence relation is $f(v, 0) = 1$ if $d$ is even, and $f(v, 0) = 0$ if $d$ is odd.

To calculate the final result, we need to sum up $f(v, d)$ for all nodes $v$ with even degrees. The total number of Eulerian subgraphs is given by the summation of $f(v, d)$ modulo $10^9+7$.

Here is the Python implementation:

```python
MOD = int(1e9) + 7

def countEulerianSubgraphs(n, m, edges):
    # Initialize the dp table
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

    # Calculate the degree of each node
    degrees = [0] * (n + 1)
    for a, b in edges:
        degrees[a] += 1
        degrees[b] += 1

    # Calculate the dp table
    for v in range(1, n + 1):
        if degrees[v] % 2 == 0:
            dp[v][0] = 1

    for v in range(1, n + 1):
        for d in range(1, n + 1):
            for u in edges[v]:
                for i in range(d + 1):
                    dp[v][d] += dp[u][i] * dp[v][d - i] % MOD
                    dp[v][d] %= MOD

    # Calculate the final result
    result = 0
    for v in range(1, n + 1):
        if degrees[v] % 2 == 0:
            result += dp[v][degrees[v]]
            result %= MOD

    return result

# Read the input
n, m = map(int, input().split())
edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    edges[a].append(b)
    edges[b].append(a)

# Calculate and print the result
result = countEulerianSubgraphs(n, m, edges)
print(result)
```

The time complexity of this solution is $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes.
