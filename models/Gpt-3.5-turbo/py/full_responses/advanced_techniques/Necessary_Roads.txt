To solve this problem, we can use the concept of Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) in a graph. 

First, we will build an adjacency list representation of the graph using the given input. Then, we will perform a Depth First Search (DFS) to find all SCCs in the graph.

For each SCC, we will check if there is more than one outgoing edge from that SCC. If there is only one outgoing edge, then that road is necessary. We will keep track of these necessary roads.

Finally, we will print the number of necessary roads and the necessary roads themselves.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

```python
# Function to perform Depth First Search (DFS) on the graph
def dfs(node, graph, visited, stack):
    visited[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            dfs(neighbor, graph, visited, stack)
    stack.append(node)

# Function to perform Reverse Depth First Search (DFS) on the transposed graph
def reverse_dfs(node, transposed_graph, visited, scc):
    visited[node] = True
    scc.append(node)
    for neighbor in transposed_graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            reverse_dfs(neighbor, transposed_graph, visited, scc)

# Function to find all Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) in the graph
def find_scc(graph, transposed_graph, n):
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    stack = []
    # Perform DFS on the graph and push nodes onto stack in order of finishing time
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            dfs(i, graph, visited, stack)
    
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    sccs = []
    # Perform Reverse DFS on the transposed graph to find SCCs
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        if not visited[node]:
            scc = []
            reverse_dfs(node, transposed_graph, visited, scc)
            sccs.append(scc)
    
    return sccs

# Function to find necessary roads in the graph
def find_necessary_roads(n, m, roads):
    # Build adjacency list representation of the graph
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    transposed_graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for road in roads:
        a, b = road
        graph[a].append(b)
        transposed_graph[b].append(a)
    
    # Find all Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) in the graph
    sccs = find_scc(graph, transposed_graph, n)
    
    necessary_roads = []
    # Check for SCCs with only one outgoing edge
    for scc in sccs:
        outgoing_edges = set()
        for node in scc:
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in scc:
                    outgoing_edges.add(neighbor)
        if len(outgoing_edges) == 1:
            necessary_roads.append(outgoing_edges.pop())
    
    return necessary_roads

# Read input
n, m = map(int, input().split())
roads = []
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    roads.append((a, b))

# Find necessary roads
necessary_roads = find_necessary_roads(n, m, roads)

# Print number of necessary roads and the necessary roads themselves
print(len(necessary_roads))
for road in necessary_roads:
    print(road)
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n + m), where n is the number of cities and m is the number of roads. This is because we perform two DFS traversals on the graph, which takes O(n + m) time, and the SCC finding step takes O(n) time.
