To solve this problem optimally, we need to find the length that all sticks should be modified to. The optimal length is the median length of all the sticks.

Here's the step-by-step solution in Python:

1. Read the input values:
```python
n = int(input())
sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
```

2. Sort the sticks in non-decreasing order:
```python
sticks.sort()
```

3. Calculate the median length:
```python
median = sticks[n // 2]
```

4. Calculate the total cost by summing the absolute differences between each stick length and the median length:
```python
total_cost = sum(abs(stick - median) for stick in sticks)
```

5. Print the total cost:
```python
print(total_cost)
```

The overall time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation.
