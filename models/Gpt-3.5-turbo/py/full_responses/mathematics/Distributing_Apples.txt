To count the number of ways to distribute the apples among the children, we can use a combinatorial approach. 

First, we need to understand that the problem is equivalent to finding the number of ways to distribute $m$ identical apples into $n$ distinct boxes. This is a classic problem in combinatorics known as "stars and bars" or "balls and urns".

The solution involves finding the number of ways to place $m$ identical apples into $n-1$ separators, where each separator represents a division between two adjacent boxes. 

The total number of positions for the apples and separators is $m + n - 1$. We need to choose the positions for the separators among these $m + n - 1$ possibilities. 

Therefore, the final solution can be calculated as:

```
def count_ways(n, m):
    mod = 10**9 + 7
    total_positions = m + n - 1
    separators = n - 1

    # Calculate the binomial coefficient using modular exponentiation
    def binomial(n, k):
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, k+1):
            res = (res * (n-i+1) // i) % mod
        return res

    # Calculate the number of ways using the binomial coefficient
    ways = binomial(total_positions, separators)
    return ways

# Read input
n, m = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate and print the number of ways
print(count_ways(n, m))
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the larger of the two input integers.
