To solve this problem, we can iterate over each integer from 1 to the given number and count the divisors.

Here is the Python code for the solution:

```python
n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    divisors = 0
    for i in range(1, x+1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors += 1
    print(divisors)
```

In this solution, we first read the number of integers, `n`, from the input. Then, we iterate `n` times to read each integer `x`. For each `x`, we initialize a variable `divisors` to 0 and iterate from 1 to `x`. If `x` is divisible by the current number `i`, we increment the `divisors` count. Finally, we print the `divisors` count for each integer.
