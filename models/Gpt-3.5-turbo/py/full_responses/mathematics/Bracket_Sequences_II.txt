To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will define a 2D array dp[i][j], where i is the length of the prefix and j is the number of open brackets.

We can fill in the array dp using the following recurrence relation:

1. If i = 0 and j = 0, dp[i][j] = 1 (since there is only one valid sequence of length 0 and 0 open brackets)
2. If i = 0 and j > 0, dp[i][j] = 0 (since we cannot have any open brackets if there are no characters in the prefix)
3. If i > 0 and j = 0, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j+1] (if the i-th character is a closing bracket, we can match it with an open bracket to form a valid sequence)
4. If i > 0 and j > 0, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j+1] (if the i-th character is an open bracket, we can either match it with a closing bracket or keep it as an open bracket)

Finally, the answer will be dp[n][0], where n is the length of the prefix.

Here is the Python implementation:

```python
MOD = int(1e9) + 7

def count_sequences(n, prefix):
    dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(len(prefix)+1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1

    for i in range(1, len(prefix)+1):
        for j in range(n+1):
            if prefix[i-1] == '(':
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j+1]) % MOD
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j+1]

    return dp[len(prefix)][0]

n = int(input())
prefix = input()

result = count_sequences(n, prefix)
print(result)
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(nk), where n is the length of the prefix and k is the number of open brackets.
